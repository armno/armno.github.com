I am a web developer living in the beautiful Chiang Mai, Thailand. I have started my career as a web developer since 2010. I work on HTML/JS/CSS and some PHP/Ruby for fun. But my favorites are still those front-end shits. Starting mid-2013, I primarily work on mobile app development using <a href="http://www.phonegap.com">PhoneGap</a>.</p>

    <p>I am learning to be a good web designer as well. I believe good designs can make websites better.</p>

    <p>My hobbies other than web are usually about <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/armno" title="Armno's Photo Gallery on Flickr">photography</a> and <a href="https://soundcloud.com/armno" title="Armno's sounds on SoundCloud">making noise</a>. I also have <a href="http://ahmalive.wordpress.com">another blog at wp.com</a>, which is about my personal life.</p>
