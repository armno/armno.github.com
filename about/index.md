สวัสดีครับ. My name is Armno. I am a frontend(-ish) developer at [BUZZWOO! Asia](http://www.buzzwoo.de/),
living in [Chiang Mai, Thailand](https://www.google.co.th/?gws_rd=cr,ssl&ei=mVnZVYKYKcKxuQSPtKG4Bg#q=chiang+mai).
I work primarily on JavaScript and CSS stuffs. My focus is currently on JavaScript in general and browser's rendering performance.

When I'm not coding, I enjoy taking [photos][instagram] of [things][flickr], reading books
and trying to put my fingers on [guitar][soundcloud] strings.

### Get in touch

It's `armno` basically everywhere on the internet. [Twitter][twitter] and [GitHub][github]
are probably the easiest ways to reach me.
