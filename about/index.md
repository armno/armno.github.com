สวัสดี. My name is Armno. I am a nerdy web developer living in the beautiful Chiang Mai, Thailand. I have started my career as a web developer since 2010. I work on HTML/JS/CSS and some PHP/Ruby for fun, but my favorites are still those front-end shits. Starting mid-2013, I primarily work on mobile app development using [Cordova][cordova].

I am learning to be a good web designer as well. I believe good design can make <del>websites</del> <ins>things</ins> better. I pretend to be a typography nerd sometimes.

My hobbies other than web are usually about [photography][flickr] and [playing guitar](soundcloud). I also have [another blog at wp.com][wp], which is about my personal life (written in Thai).
