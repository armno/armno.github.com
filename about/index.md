Hi. My name is Armno. I am a web developer living in the beautiful Chiang Mai, Thailand. I have started my career as a web developer since 2010. I work on HTML/JS/CSS and some PHP/Ruby for fun. But my favorites are still those front-end shits. Starting mid-2013, I primarily work on mobile app development using [Cordova](http://cordova.io)

I am learning to be a good web designer as well. I believe good designs can make websites better.

My hobbies other than web are usually about [photography](http://www.flickr.com/photos/armno) and [makeing noise](https://soundcloud.com/armno). I also have [another blog at wp.com](http://ahmalive.wordpress.com), which is about my personal life (written in Thai).
